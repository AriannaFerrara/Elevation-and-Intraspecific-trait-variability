R scripts for the analysis for the paper: Elevation differently shapes functional diversity patterns in understory forest communities when considering intraspecific and interspecific trait variability 


Abstract 

Questions: What is the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific trait variation in temperate forest herb-layer, and how do they vary with elevation? Is there evidence of interspecific trait convergence at higher elevation, and is this convergence enhanced or counteracted by intraspecific variation? 

Location: Parco Nazionale Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona and Campigna, central Italy.  

Methods: We measured four functional traits – Plant height, Specific leaf area (SLA), Leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and Leaf area – across 775 individuals from 60 herb-layer species in 28 forest plots (10 x 10 m) spanning an 800 m elevation gradient. For each trait in each plot, we computed community weighted means (CWMs) and the standardized effect size of functional diversity (SES-FD), and decomposed total trait variation into interspecific, intraspecific components and their covariation. We used linear regression models to assess impact of elevation on interspecific and intraspecific components of functional variation. Lastly, we investigated whether higher elevation communities exhibited lower SES-FD, indicating functional convergence. 

Results: Both inter- and intraspecific variation played similar roles in overall trait variation, whether looking at CWMs or SES-FD. Only CWMs calculated for plant height and LDMC showed a significant relationship with elevation. Low-elevation communities featured taller, conservative species, while high-elevation communities had shorter, faster-growing ones. SES-FD remained consistently below zero for species turnover and total variation, suggesting functional convergence was stable across the elevation gradient. 

Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of considering all components of variation when studying how communities respond to environmental gradients. Such an approach helps us understand key drivers of community composition and gain insights into how communities respond to climate change, an increasingly urgent topic. Finally, our results show that the elevation gradient affects various components of plant community function, with habitat filtering playing a significant role in selecting plants with specific traits across the overall gradient.
